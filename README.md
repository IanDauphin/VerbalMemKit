VerbalMemKit will be an open-source toolkit designed to automate and standardize the correction and analysis of verbal stimulus data in various memory research paradigms.
Soon to be available as a Shiny application and R/Python package, it aims to be a one-stop shop for those looking for an efficient and reliable way to correct their data, 
especially semantically or phonologically similar stimuli.

VerbalMemKit's parameters are ajustable, and so it will be able to be configured to correct spelling mistakes according to your own level of tolerance and list-lengths.
The project was born out of the pain felt by Ian Dauphinee when manually correcting the hundreds of datafiles he collected as part of his Master's degree in psychology. 
We hope others won't have to endure this pain, so we've made it our mission to create VerbalMemKit.


We hope to see you soon!
